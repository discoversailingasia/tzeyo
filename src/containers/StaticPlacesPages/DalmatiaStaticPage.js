              Makarska
              </h3>

              <p>
              Makarska is a combination of a cosmopolitan seaside town, with its pretty promenade, and popular family resort in summer. It is a perfect mix for travellers who want a bit of a mix of everything, from beaches to reasonably lively nightlife, as well as a bit of adventure (hiking on Mount Biokovo, which looms over Makarska impressively). The town is convenient  to reach from Split (and itâ€™s often a stop on buses between Split and Dubrovnik). There are ferry and catamaran connections to Brac, although plenty of other day trip excursions to the local area (to the islands, to Split, and more) are also possible.

              </p>

              <h3 className={css.subtitle}>Sibenik</h3>
              <p>
              Sibenik is one of the larger port towns of Croatia. A narrow channel, the mouth of the river Krka, which pulls up to Skradin and the famous waterfalls, separates Sibenik from the open sea. In the old town, numerous well-preserved stone works of art from the Middle Ages have been preserved. On the harbor promenade below the famous cathedral cafes, restaurants and bars line up.
